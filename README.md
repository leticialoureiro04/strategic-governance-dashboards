### Standardized colors / thresholds
- **Green**: good performance  
- **Yellow**: attention needed  
- **Red**: critical

## 🛠️ How to Import the Dashboards into Grafana

1. Go to Grafana → *Dashboards* → **Import**  
2. Upload a `.json` file from the `dashboards/` folder in this repository  
3. **Select Data Source**:  
   - The JSONs were created using **grafana-testdata-datasource** with the *Scenario* **CSV Content** (ideal for demo).  
   - For real data, connect to your own source (e.g., Prometheus, Postgres, CSV plugin, etc.).  
4. Click **Import** → the panel will appear in Grafana.  

> **Tip**: to modify example data, open the panel → **Edit** → *Queries* section → *Scenario*: **CSV Content** and edit the embedded CSV (e.g., `month,value`).

## 🧪 Example Data (Jul–Sep)

The dashboards include **fictitious demo data** to illustrate:

- **Percentage metrics** (e.g., satisfaction, digital usage, FCR)  
- **Count metrics** (e.g., initiatives, automated calls, complaints)  
- **Average response time (days)**  

> These demo values can be replaced with real integrations (DB, APIs, etc.).
